# PDX Bus Driver Sim 2000
*Extreme Alpha Edition*

This is a demo that uses the [TriMet Vehicle Location Service API](http://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/vehicle_locations_ws.shtml) mashed up with the Google StreetView API to simulate driving a bus in the city of Portland, Oregon.

**unfinished & unmaintained - please jump in and make it better!**
